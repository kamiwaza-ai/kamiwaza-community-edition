# Kamiwaza Community Edition

Orchestrate Autonomous AI. Everywhere.

Build and run intelligent agents, automated workflows, and contextual search over distributed data — locally or in the cloud. Community Edition gives developers a full‑stack environment for model management, data ingestion/retrieval, and inference that is aligned with Kamiwaza’s core pillars: Distributed Data Engine and Inference Mesh.

## What’s included in Community Edition

- Local model repository with REST APIs and a React UI
- Data catalog with file/object ingestion and credential management
- Embedding and vector DB middleware (model‑aware chunking, offset tracking)
- Single‑node cluster runtime (macOS and Linux), consistent with enterprise behavior
- Integrated components (e.g., vLLM/llama.cpp, DataHub, Traefik) pre‑wired
- JupyterLab environment and sample notebooks
- Auth via JWT; SSL/TLS enabled by default (self‑signed supported)

Enterprise adds multi‑node orchestration, scaled multi‑model deployments, SSO/SAML/OAuth, and multi‑location/data‑affinity awareness. Contact: hello@kamiwaza.ai.
